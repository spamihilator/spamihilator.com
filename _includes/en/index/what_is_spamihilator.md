### What is Spamihilator?

<h5 class="subheader">
Spamihilator works between your email client and the Internet and examines every
incoming message. Useless and unsolicited spam mails (junk) will be filtered out. This process runs
completely in the background. Spamihilator uses a number of different filters
in order to achieve the highest spam recognition rate possible. The
program is highly configurable and can be extended by plugins.
